<p>&ldquo;Upwards of five hundred thousand two-legged animals without

</blockquote>


<h2 class="nobreak">I.</h2>

<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>E HAD agreed, my companion and I, that I should
call for him at his house, after dinner, not later than
eleven o&rsquo;clock.</p>

<p>This athletic young Frenchman belongs to a
small set of Parisian sportsmen, who have taken up &ldquo;ballooning&rdquo;
as a pastime.</p>

<p>After having exhausted all the sensations that are to be
found in ordinary sports, even those of &ldquo;automobiling&rdquo; at a
breakneck speed, the members of the &ldquo;A&eacute;ro Club&rdquo; now seek in
the air, where they indulge in all kinds of daring feats, the nerve-racking
excitement that they have ceased to find on earth.</p>

<p>I might add that these facts were but vaguely known to me
before I had been introduced, by a mutual friend, to this <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">nouveau
si&egrave;cle</i> young sportsman, and had accepted his invitation to
accompany him in his next aerial voyage.</p>

<p>When we reached the vacant lot at the huge gas works of
St. Denis, where our balloon was being inflated, I could not help
feeling a bit alarmed at the sight of that little bubble&mdash;only a
few hundred cubic metres&mdash;and the very small basket which
were soon to take us up in the air.</p>

<p>All the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">&eacute;clat</i>, the ceremonial, and the emotional &ldquo;good-bys&rdquo;
that usually accompany the &ldquo;let her go!&rdquo; of a balloon, were
totally lacking when the &ldquo;Rolla&rdquo; left the earth. The start was
effected in a quiet and business like manner, and the act seemed
so natural to the people who were helping us off, that their demeanor
on this occasion had a beneficial and soothing effect on
my excited nerves.</p>

</div>

<p>A few minutes after midnight, when
the last little sacks of sand ballast had
been hung out over the edge of our
wicker-basket, when a final glance had
been given to the ropes, the net, the
valve, etc.,&mdash;with a careless <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au revoir</i> from
the foreman of the gas-works, and a parting
joke from the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cocher</i> who had driven
us there,&mdash;the dark forms, whose hands
were holding us down, silently stepped
back, and with a gentle and graceful
swing the &ldquo;Rolla&rdquo; started off on its sixth
ascension.</p>



<p class="break">Had we taken with us another small
sack of ballast, our balloon could not
have left the earth. In other words, its
ascensional force was almost balanced by
the weight it was expected to carry. After
rising a few hundred feet, and finding a
cooler current, which slightly condensed
the gas, the &ldquo;Rolla&rdquo; ceased to ascend.
We were met by a gentle breeze from the
north west, and began to cross Paris, a
couple of hundred yards above the city.</p>

<p>It would take the pen of a Carlyle to
describe our mysterious flight over Paris
at midnight. The impression was so
startling that for an hour we never spoke
above a whisper.</p>

<p>Owing to the increasing coolness of
the atmosphere, our balloon had a slight,
though constant, tendency to descend.
But we easily kept our altitude by occasionally
throwing overboard a spoonful or
two of ballast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>5]</a></span>
After ascertaining that we would not come in contact with
the towers of Notre Dame or the sharp edges of the Eiffel
Tower, we decided to keep the same distance, and let the breeze
do the rest.</p>



<p class="break">At our feet Paris is breathing, like a monster with a million
eyes.</p>

<p>On the right, at the very top of Montmartre, and looming
up in the glow that surrounds it, stands the white Basilica of the
Sacred Heart, with its colossal marble statue of the Redeemer
watching over the city.</p>

<p>The great boulevards roll out in every direction like ribbons
of fire; we can hear, as we sail over them, the muffled rumbling
of a thousand carriages, and we watch them as they dodge each
other in their complicated course.</p>

<p>A cry, a call, from time to time, reaches our ears; but the
others are lost in the mighty silence above us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is the Op&eacute;ra,&rdquo; whispers the owner, as he points to a
square silhouette, bathed in a lake of electric light.</p>

<p>I seem to have no fear, merely the sensation of relief that
follows an irrevocable decision; with the feeling that we are
tasting a forbidden fruit, breaking some divine and primeval law.
All our faculties are concentrated in our eyes, and they feast on
this wonderful sight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those dark pits that dot the surface of Paris are gardens,&rdquo;
explains the owner, &ldquo;innumerable private parks; and most Parisians
live and die without ever suspecting their existence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We cross the Place de la Bastille, soaring above the bronze
column, with its graceful statue of Liberty, whose useless wings
of metal seem childish and a bit ridiculous as we pass on.</p>

<p>A long and purple fissure that cuts the city in twain marks
the Seine, long before we reach it. The &ldquo;Rolla&rdquo; feels the cool
current that rises above the waters. A few handfuls of sand
thrown overboard, and we resume our former position.</p>

<p>Our eyes are now accustomed to these weird and unusual
effects, and few details of the picture escape us. In the distance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>6]</a></span>
another bright spot, Bullier, the students&rsquo; ball, in the heart of
the Latin quarter. That obscure mass beyond must be the
Luxembourg and its gardens.</p>

<p>Here we leave the dome of the Panth&eacute;on on our right.
Below us the lights are gradually thinning out; we are passing
over the crowded <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">faubourgs</i>, where thousands of poor and tired
human beings are resting in sleep.</p>

<p>An ocean of darkness and silence opens up before us; we
sail into it. The breeze freshens, and the glowing blaze of
Paris soon fades away in the distance.</p>



<p class="break">From now on the minutes drag, in the awful silence of this
mysterious night, and every moment is heavy with anxiety.
Those hours are endless, really hard to live, until at last the
gray dawn steps out of the horizon.</p>

<p>Nature begins to awaken, and, with the first gleam of daylight,
slowly the world comes back to life.</p>

<p>The first cry of a quail or the cackle of a pheasant is a delight
to our ears. A dog barks and another howls. Lazy and
sleepy peasants, leading huge oxen, drag themselves out of their
farms, on their way to a hard day&rsquo;s work in the fields. The
cocks crow lustily, and, in the distance, from the little town
of Nemours, comes the melodious call of a bugle, arousing
&ldquo;Pitou,&rdquo; the French &ldquo;Tommy Atkins,&rdquo; from his sleep.</p>

<p>The sun drives away the soft gray mist that lingers over the
meadows; a few shadows here and there still mark the wooded
valleys; but they soon melt away, and a glorious summer morning,
in the beautiful land of Burgundy, bursts upon us from
every side.</p>

<blockquote>
<p lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">&ldquo;Oh! qui n&rsquo;a pas senti son c&oelig;ur battre plus vite,<br />
A l&rsquo;heure o&ugrave; sous le ciel l&rsquo;homme est seul avec Dieu!&rdquo;</p>

</blockquote>



<h2 class="nobreak">II.</h2>

<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>E ARE now passing over the little hamlet of Uri,
and the voice of a cuckoo-clock tells us the hour, as
it pipes up in the breeze its five double notes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The temperature is very even,&rdquo; remarks the
captain, &ldquo;and there is no danger of it rising or falling unexpectedly,
at least not for an hour or more. We might as well travel
with the guide-rope, and skip along close to the earth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He slips the line overboard and lowers it carefully to the
ground.</p>

<p>The guide-rope, though a mere cable, about two hundred
feet in length, is a very delicate accessory to a balloon, and
the most important after the anchor. When in operation, one
end of the rope is attached to the basket, and a quarter or a
fifth of its length is allowed to drag on the surface of the earth,
where it regulates automatically the air-ship&rsquo;s aerostatic equilibrium.</p>

<p>If the balloon has a tendency to fall, an additional portion of
the guide-rope drops upon the ground. Instantly the &ldquo;Rolla&rdquo;
is relieved of that much weight, and soon resumes its former
altitude.</p>

<p>On the other hand, should its tendency be to rise, the extra
amount of rope that it hauls up with it means for the &ldquo;Rolla&rdquo;
a few pounds more to carry, and it gradually falls back to its
original position.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 134px;">
<img src="images/baam04.jpg" width="134" height="700"
alt="The balloon flies over fields and forests" />
</div>

<p>It has also the serious advantage of saving gas, and sand
ballast as well.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That modest young fellow you met at dinner the other
night,&rdquo; remarks the captain, &ldquo;uses the guide-rope with great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>8]</a></span>
success as part of the steering-gear of his
new <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">aeronef</i>, the &lsquo;Santos-Dumont V.&rsquo; We
all expect to hear within a few weeks that
Santos-Dumont has solved the great
problem of aerial navigation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The farmers who can not understand
this new method of locomotion are all
eager to tug at the guide-rope, thinking
we have decided to land.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mais non! Laissez donc!</i>&rdquo; shouts
the owner; &ldquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">nous nous promenons, tout simplement.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>The children, who are playing scarecrow
with the ravenous birds in the orchards,
scream with astonishment and
delight. An old woman folds her hands
over her mouth like a megaphone, and asks:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ou diable allez-vous donc?</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">A la lune!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ha! Ha! Bon Voyage!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>A flock of sheep stampedes at the
sight of our shadow moving upon the
earth, and disappears in a cloud of dust.</p>

<p>We glide peacefully over meadows
and swamps, clearing hedges and trees,
dragging the guide-rope behind us. As
we pass over a lake in the park of an
ideal country seat, we see the &ldquo;Rolla&rdquo; reflected
in the clear waters below.</p>

<p>Even at this moderate height, the
farms look like children&rsquo;s playhouses,
with their curly little lambs, their wooden
horses, and painted cows; and as we approach
a curve on the railroad track, a
train puffs by like a mechanical toy, and
whistles a friendly salute.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>9]</a></span>
Here the captain calls my attention to a dark line of clouds
in the north west.</p>

<p>Yesterday&rsquo;s <i>Herald</i> predicted a depression within the next
twenty-four hours; evidently a storm is creeping up behind us.
But the same wind is driving us on, and we hope to keep out of
its reach, even if we have to rise up in the heavens above it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If our balloon obeys as it should, we will soon have some
fun,&rdquo; says the captain, as we reach the first trees of a thick
forest.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Rolla&rdquo; is so sensitive that by merely hauling in a few
yards of the guide-rope, we gently descend on the tops of the
trees, lightly skipping from one to the other; we brush by an
elm, a poplar, or an ash, and as we pass, pick their fresh green
leaves.</p>

<p>This weird performance is fascinating beyond words. I have
never heard of a &ldquo;promenade&rdquo; on the crest of a forest, and I
wonder now and then if I am dreaming.</p>

<p>Such accuracy of movement is only possible with a very
small balloon, in the early hours of the day, and with a perfectly
even temperature. Of course, it is always dangerous, as a slight
mistake would instantly lead to a hopeless disaster.</p>

<p>Suddenly, while crossing a deep ravine, the coolness of the
air drags us down. The rocky banks of the torrent are upon us.</p>

<p>As I open my mouth to offer a mild objection; a hatful of
ballast goes overboard; we instantly shoot up in the air, and,
before I can realize what has occurred, the barometer marks six
and seven thousand feet.</p>

</blockquote>



<h2 class="nobreak">III.</h2>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span> SHALL never forget this first and sudden leap to such
terrifying altitudes. I thought we would never stop
rising, and stood breathless as I saw the earth leave us,
sink in at the centre, and swell out at the horizon like
a bowl.</p>

<p>How often have we not followed with delighted eyes the
majestic flight of the clouds, and longed for their liberty and the
freedom of their voyages in the skies?</p>

<p>Rolled in heavy masses by the winds that drive them on,
they move peacefully in the sunlight like a fleet of sombre ships,
with prows of solid gold. Now bunched together in small and
graceful groups, thin and sleek like birds of passage, they fly
swiftly with the breeze, iridescent and translucent, like huge
opals picked from the treasures of heaven, or sparkling with
immaculate candor, like the snow the winds harvest on the
crest of inaccessible <i>sierras</i>, and carry off on their invisible
wings.</p>

<p>They have seen, perhaps in a single day, the countries and
the homes we love, and cherish in remembrance or in hope.
They have passed over spots that have beaten time to our happiest
hours; they have looked down upon places that have witnessed
our deepest sorrows.</p>

<p>Up to their glittering realm we rise, and cutting through the
impalpable vapor, we reach the upper spheres of everlasting
starlight and sunshine, where the limits of the empyrean begin,
that mysterious zone, visited only by the queen bee, once in her
lifetime, on the day of her &ldquo;nuptial flight.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>11]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>Followed by ten thousand lovers, each
with ten thousand eyes to watch her, she
ascends like a prayer in the sweet-scented
freshness of the morning.</p>

<p>The amorous horde, like the moving
tail of a comet, devours the space beneath
her.</p>

<p>Never before has she breathed the
dew-laden breeze, never has she felt the
blinding rays of the sun.</p>

<p>But she has heard the eternal voice of
nature; and drunk with the perfume of a
million flowers, staggered by the riotous
cries and plaintive wails of her wooing
drones, transfixed by the ocean of divine
light above her, she rises to heights unknown.
One by one, her exhausted
lovers have given up the chase and fallen
like so many stones in the depths of the
abyss below: strange and mystic manifestation
of the survival of the fittest.</p>

<p>Now a mere handful, with throbbing
flanks and starting eyeballs, strives to
follow her to the mysterious sacrifice of
royal love and death.</p>

<p>One, the last one, the Chosen one
reaches his Queen; her arms are open to
receive him, and he falls in their mortal
embrace. He lives his whole life in a
second, and gives up the ghost in one
gasp of ineffable ecstasy.</p>



<p class="break">The varied emotions of our trip above
the clouds are simply superhuman, but
the owner does not seem to enjoy them:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">On ne s&rsquo;amuse pas ici&mdash;descendons.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>12]</a></span>
I know he is longing to play with the trees again; but before
I can answer, the valve-rope is jerked, and we drop two or
three thousand feet.</p>

<p>Looking up through the open appendix, I can see the interior
of the balloon, the valve-rope hanging in the centre, and
watch the valve open and close at the top.</p>

<p>We are now traveling with the wind at a speed of forty miles
an hour, but we feel no motion whatever. The hills, the meadows,
the hamlets, rush toward us in a mad race, as if driven by
the mighty hand of God.</p>

<p>The world looks like a painted atlas, with every little detail
carefully marked. As I compare it with the military map in
my hands, I can not tell which is the better of the two; and,
moreover, at this altitude, they both seem the same size.</p>

<p>The captain is throwing out ballast,&mdash;quite a lot it seems to
me. But the barometer is still falling. Down we go, and in a
moment we are close to earth again. Half a dozen peasants are
harvesting in the grain fields.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Captain! we are dead birds this time!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pas encore</i>,&rdquo; replies the owner, &ldquo;but be sure before we
touch ground to swing up on the hoop above you or the shock
might break your legs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The advice is worth following. No sooner said than done,
and the basket after kicking off the top of a haystack, drops
in the midst of the dumfounded farmers.</p>

<p>Relieved for a second of its weight, the &ldquo;Rolla&rdquo; bounds
ahead. More ballast flies out, and we are off on another trip to
the clouds.</p>



<p class="break">Exposed, as it is, alternately to the burning rays of the
sun and the numerous cool currents that we meet on our
way, the &ldquo;Rolla&rdquo; soon becomes flighty and hard to control.
A few minutes later we are not two hundred feet over the
meadows.</p>

<p>Another rise, without apparently any cause for it, and soon
we are falling again; this time over the ancient city of Sens, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>13]</a></span>
its beautiful cathedral, around which the quaint old houses are
huddled, and held close together by a belt of green boulevards.</p>

<p>As I wonder how we would look impaled on that sharp
gothic steeple, a dozen pounds of ballast sends us skyward like
a rocket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the distance, it&rsquo;s the pace that kills.&rdquo;</p>

</blockquote>



<h2 class="nobreak">IV.</h2>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>T WAS then ten o&rsquo;clock. We had traveled by actual measurement
on the map, one hundred and eighty kilometers.
The heat was increasing rapidly and the sensitive bubble
over our heads had become more erratic than ever. Down
it would drop a few thousand feet, if a cloud happened to
darken the sun, and then up three or four thousand, as soon as
the cloud had passed on.</p>

<p>This constant &ldquo;bobbing&rdquo; up and down at a terrific pace,
added to the heat and lack of sleep, was gradually telling on
our nerves. Ten hours in a basket, under such circumstances,
is about as much as any ordinary man can stand. Without
wasting any time in idle discussion, we decided to <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">atterrir</i>&mdash;in
other words, to land, as soon as the necessary arrangements for
this important operation had been completed.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Rolla&rdquo; was then at nine thousand feet; we had lost
the wind on our way up, and below, in the west, the storm was
rapidly gaining on us.</p>

<p>We had still four sacks of sand ballast of the nine we had
taken up with us. Every knot that held them to the basket
was carefully examined; a precaution of vital importance, as we
would soon be above the clouds again, if any of them escaped
us in the varied incidents that might attend our descent. The
lunch-basket and our coats were also securely fastened, and the
anchor partly unlashed and made ready to be dropped.</p>

<p>I held the barometer, with eyes glued upon its face, ready to
call out our future altitudes. My companion, with the valve-rope
in his right and the ballast-spoon within reach, was still
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>15]</a></span>
gazing earnestly at the fields in the distance,
where we hoped we might stand
alive a few minutes later.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 145px;">
<img src="images/baam06.jpg" width="145" height="700"
alt="A woman looks up at the balloon" />
</div>

<p>Not a word had been spoken for
some time, when the captain said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our landing, I think, will be a hard
one. I dislike the way those trees are
scattered beyond that narrow valley. We
never should have allowed the storm
to reach our heels,&mdash;but it has to go
now&mdash;&mdash;,&rdquo; and his hand gives the valve-rope
a long and heavy pull.</p>

<p>We can hear the gas sputter as it
leaves the creaking silk.</p>

<p>Instantly the barometer drops. We
have started on our final descent.</p>



<p class="break">The captain&rsquo;s fondness for &ldquo;valving&rdquo;
had set us falling again at an awful speed,
and the sand he was throwing out was
rising around the &ldquo;Rolla&rdquo; in little thin
clouds, and dropping like hail on the silk
above us.</p>

<p>I looked down. The earth was rising!&mdash;rising
to meet us, like a fabulous
mother eager to receive her children in
her outstretched arms.</p>

<p>I stood hypnotized and cold, until
called back to my barometer. I saw
that the captain&rsquo;s teeth were set, but his
eye was clear and serene.</p>

<p>We now realize to its full extent the
<em>gravity</em> of the situation.</p>

<p>The needle is jumping in my hands.
&ldquo;Twenty-two hundred metres&mdash;twenty-one-fifty&mdash;twenty-one&mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo;
The storm
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>16]</a></span>
is not a mile behind us, and the heavy wind that precedes it
rolls in graceful waves over the wheat and barley fields.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seventeen hundred and fifty metres&mdash;seventeen hundred&mdash;sixteen
hundred&mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>We are falling at an angle of thirty or forty degrees. Everything
below us is moving at lightning speed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Twelve hundred and fifty&mdash;twelve hundred&mdash;eleven hundred
metres&mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>My voice is slightly hoarse, but I call out the numbers as
fast as I see them, and they follow each other in rapid succession.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nine hundred&mdash;eight hundred and fifty&mdash;eight hundred
metres&mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sudden change of altitude makes us both very deaf;
but I can still hear the captain say:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Haul in the other sack of sand!&mdash;We must keep up long
enough to clear that forest and land in the field beyond, this
side of the large clump of trees.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The ballast is doing better work, and we are not falling so
rapidly; but only half of the treacherous forest has been cleared:
there is more and enough of it, that stands threatening below us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall never sail over it,&rdquo; mutters the owner.</p>

<p>At this moment we swing into a violent gale, forerunner of
the storm behind us. The &ldquo;Rolla&rdquo; quivers in its net, seems to
hesitate for a mere second, and bravely leaps ahead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too much of a good thing&mdash;&mdash;,&rdquo; and above us the valve
is roaring furiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whatever happens, don&rsquo;t jump!&rdquo; cries the captain.</p>

<p>Of course, had I done so at any time, he would have shot
up in the air ten or fifteen thousand feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Attention! Voici le moment psychologique&mdash;&mdash;.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Like a hawk swooping down on its prey, and with the same
graceful curve, the &ldquo;Rolla&rdquo; clears, with ten feet to spare, the
crest of the last trees.</p>

<p>We hear the guide-rope dragging in the branches.</p>

<p>As quick as a flash the captain has the anchor overboard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>17]</a></span>
But the gale is driving us on, and the iron teeth fail to bite
the sod.</p>

<p>We clutch at the hoop and the rigging above, and with a
crash, the basket strikes the earth.</p>

<p>The shock throws us back into it.</p>

<p>The balloon bounds on several hundred feet, rolling like a
huge football. We are dragged, tossed, bumped, and bruised.
Everything in the basket is smashed, and the claret on the captain&rsquo;s
face looks like blood.</p>

<p>I barely have time to disengage my neck from a couple of
slender and wiry net ropes that are doing their best to strangle
me.</p>

<p>A peasant, mowing near by, hears our cries; he drops his
scythe, and kicking off his wooden shoes, tugs at the guide-rope
lustily.</p>

<p>The anchor has found a soft spot, suddenly the cable tightens,
and our aerial trip is ended.</p>

<p>By this time a few excited villagers have come to the rescue
from the neighboring fields.</p>

<p>As we crawl from under the tangled mass of net-work and
rigging, a terrorized child falls in a fit at the sight of this unusual
performance, rolling in the grass and screaming with fright.</p>

<p>We are both rather pale and a bit weak in the knees; but,
oh! the exquisite sensation to feel the good old Earth under our
feet again!</p>



<p class="break">A few steps away, &ldquo;Rolla&rdquo; lies panting in the sunshine.</p>

<p>With every gust of wind he seems to exhale his life.</p>

<p>His quivering form is sinking rapidly; we hear his heavy
sighs and watch his quivering skin.</p>

<p>The plucky little fellow makes another desperate effort to
rise up to the spheres he has conquered; but his strength at
last betrays him, and he falls back on the green, empty, motionless,
dead.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
